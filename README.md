# Python Slack Bot
Final year project for my Comp Sci degree

This project allows communication with a database via Slack using Slack's web API. Specifically Middlesex University's database that contains data from the Student Observable Behavior system.

This is a partially finished project so take a look at my dissertation in the git for detail on progress so far and how to set up on your local machine.
